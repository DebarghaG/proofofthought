Fred can be kind but he will talks so much his face turns blue. He is usually red and round other than that. Young round people who are green are usually blue. Rough and big people are always also cold people. I've noticed that nice people who have rough, green skin have a tendancy to be round. A nice, green, big person is also sure to be a red person. Anyone feeling cold is bound to act nice. People who are round and behave in a cold way are surely blue.",
